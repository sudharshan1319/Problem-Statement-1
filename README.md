# Problem-Statement-1
Problem Statement:  
Estimate the occurrence of a supermoon using the ephemeris data for the moon.

Input:
Ephemeris data for the moon, including the moon's distance from Earth (perigee distance) and its phase age.

Output:
A prediction of the occurrence of a supermoon, based on the following criteria:
A supermoon occurs when the full moon is at or within 90% of its perigee distance.
The moon should also be the brightest at that point in time.

Evaluation:
The performance of the code would be evaluated by comparing its predictions to the actual occurrences of supermoons.

Constraints:
The code must be able to generalize to new data, meaning that it should be able to predict the occurrence of a supermoon accurately even if it has not seen the ephemeris data for that date before.

Potential Applications:
This model could be used to help astronomers and photographers predict the occurrence of supermoons, so that they can plan their sessions accordingly.
